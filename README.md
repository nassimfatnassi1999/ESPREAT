# MicroServices_Project_PI
My project involves developing a comprehensive application using Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend microservices. The architecture is built on a robust microservices framework, ensuring scalability and modularity. To facilitate deployment and management, I utilized Terraform to create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This automated infrastructure setup enables seamless scalability and efficient resource management. The deployment consists of eight separate deployments, each running eight pods. Each pod houses a microservice along with a dedicated database container, ensuring isolated and efficient data handling. This setup not only enhances the resilience and maintainability of the application but also leverages the powerful cloud capabilities of Azure for optimized performance and scalability.
